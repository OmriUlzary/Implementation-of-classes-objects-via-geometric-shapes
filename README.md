# Implementation-of-classes-objects-via-geometric-shapes
In this exercise, I applied classes &amp; objects by using geometric shapes. Each shape is defined to be a class in which I have built an object containing its attributes. After building the required classes in the exercise, I built an easy-to-use user interface so the user could simply implement the functions I built.
