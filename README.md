Part I - Building the Classes and Objects 
We built a class for a point object that gets the x and y values of a new point. This class will be used to build points for all other classes. In addition, in this class, we have built the function 'get_distance ()' that will be used to measure the distances between points for the triangle class. 
1. We built a class for the rectangle object. For this object we built a constructor that gets the attributes Length, Width and Start Point. The Start Point was imported from the point class. We defined the length and width of the rectangle to be numbers greater than 0. 
In this class, we implemented the functions that return the rectangle area, the diagonal length, a list containing the four rectangle points and the two functions 'get_value_height (value)' and 'get_value_width (value)' that take a value from the user and add it to the rectangle height and rectangle length accordingly. In the function that returns the rectangle area, we used the formula that finds the rectangle area: S = height * base. In a function that returns the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, we used the formula that finds a distance between two points: d² = (x1-x2) ² + (y1-y2) ². In the 'get_border_points ()' function, we defined the starting point and added the length and width of the rectangle to the coordinates to find the rest of the border’s points. 
2. We built a class for a triangle object. This object was built with a constructor. His attributes were a list containing the 3 points of the triangle. The three points will be imported from the point class. In this class, we implemented the 'add_value_x (index, value)' function that gets a value and index from the user and adds this value to the x coordinate of the point in the same index. We implemented a similar function 'add_value_y (index, value)' that adds the value to the y coordinate of the point in the selected index. We built the 'get_edges_length ()' function to return the triangle edges lengths. To find the entire length we built a call to the list of triangle points that gets the point from which we wanted to measure the triangle length. The selected point is implemented in the 'get_distance ()' function, which is in the class of point. The 'get_distance ()' function has the second point coordinates values of the edge length measurement. For the 'get_height ()' function we used 
the straight-point distance formula: . The 'get_area ()' function uses a formula for a triangle area: 𝑆 = ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡∗𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 2
 
3. We built a class for a circle object. This object was built with a constructor whose attributes were the center point taken from the point class and the radius of the circle. We defined the radius of the circle to be greater than 0. In this class, we used the 'get_area ()' function to find the circle area. To find the area of the circle we used the formula: S = πr * 2. In addition, we implemented the 'get_circumence ()' function to find the circumference of the circle. To find the circumference of the circle we used the formula: P = 2 * πr. We also implemented the 'is_contains_point (x, y)' function that gets x and y- as the point coordinates and returns True if the point is in the circle. We applied this function with the circle equation: (𝑋 − 𝑥0)2 + (𝑌 − 𝑦0)2 = 𝑅2.  
Part 2 – User Interface 
In this part of the assignment, we were asked to build a user interface based on the classes and the entities we built in the previous assignment. There are 7 buttons from 0 to 6 the user can press and use those options.                                                                                          Input 0 – by pressing this button the program print "bye-bye" and the use of the interface will stop.                                                                                                                                             Input 1 – the program will ask for two floats: width and length and to input a point. by asking that, the program will be aided by the function 'get_point_from_user', the purpose of the function is to get a coordinator of 'x' and 'y' and then to return a point which based on the class "Point". After that, the program will put in the variable 'rectangle' the length, width, and the point by aiding the class "Rectangle". In the end, the variable will enter to global list calls 'rectangle_list'.                                                                                                       Input 2 – the user will enter three points by aiding the function 'get_point_from_user', the program will put in the variable 'triangle' three points by aiding the class "Triangle". In the end, the variable will enter to a global list which calls 'triangle_list'.                                          Input 3 – the program will ask for 'x' and 'y' coordinators by using the function 'get_point_from_user'. After that, the user will prompt to input 'radius'. by aiding the class "Circle", the program will put in the variable 'circle' the 'radius' and the 'circle_point' which include 'x' and 'y' coordinators and will add it to a global list which calls 'circle_list'.         Input 4 – the program will run on every rectangle in 'rectangle_list', it will calculate the area of the rectangle by using the function of calculating area in rectangle class and check if every next rectangle area is bigger than the one who defined as the biggest rectangle area before. In the end, it will print the details of the rectangle which has the biggest area.                   Input 5 – the user enters a value. Then, the program will make three loops in every global list we created, in each loop the program will run on every rectangle, triangle and circle in the lists and will add the value that entered to every 'x' coordinator by aiding the 'add_vlaue_x' function we built in class "Point".                                                                         Input 6 – the program will ask for a point and index in the 'circle_list'. The program will calculate if the point of the user entered is inside or outside the circle by aiding the function 'is_contain_point' which we created in "Circle" class. The program will return true or false if the point is inside or outside the circle.                                                                                      Insights- 1. Following the construction of the classes, we have come to realize that when we build an object in a class, you can use objects from another class. For example, in the rectangle class in the creation of a rectangle object, we used from the class point, Point style object. 2. Understand that when you want to build a list of points in the builder, it is better to put in a blank list builder. In order not to define a large number of variables, we will define the size of the list that we want within the object itself in the class. The inclusion of a large list within the object allows flexibility. For example, if the user wants to build a hexagonal form of 6 points, we do not need to define 12 variables. We can run the size of the list instead of setting a new class of hexagon.
